<h1>Python - Introduction</h1>


<p>	
Before you begin your journey into Python, we need to know what it is first. Simply speaking, Python is a programming language, a language that humans use to talk to computers.

<p>	
This means that Python has many uses. For example, when talking to a computer, we can use Python to tell the computer to do math for us, or read off a grocery list.

And, because of these abilities, Python also has many real-world applications, for example, Google often uses Python. So, if you want a job in the tech industry, Python is a good starting point.

But, how do we speak Python to a computer? Well, we will need an IDE. What’s an IDE? It’s what we write code in, to then give to the computer to read. There are many IDEs you can use, but here are some free options.
</p>



<ol>
  <li>Replit (requires account)</li>
  <li>Programiz (no account required, but does not save work)
</li>
  <li>Python Windows download (most difficult, but practical option)</li>
</ol>
