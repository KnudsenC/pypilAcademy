  <p>Your library needs you! The library has a total of 100 books, 25 fiction books, 12 non-fiction books, 30 fantasy books, 7 biographies, and 26 mystery books.</p>
  <p>But, that's not all! The library has 3 special books titles it puts on display every day, those are: "War and Peace," "The Great Gatsby," and "Of Mice and Men"</p>
  <p>Lastly, the library has opening and closing hours. The library opens at 7AM and closes at 5PM. That means that it is <strong>True</strong> that the library is open after 7AM, but <strong>False</strong> that the library is open after 5PM.</p>
